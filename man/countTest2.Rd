\arguments{
\item{DS}{A 'glmDataSet' object, which is created with function
\code{\link[MethylIT]{glmDataSet}}.}

\item{num.cores, tasks}{Parameters for parallel computation using package
\code{\link[BiocParallel]{BiocParallel-package}}: the number of cores to
use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously
(see \code{\link[BiocParallel]{bplapply}} and the number of tasks per job
(only for Linux OS).}

\item{countFilter}{whether or not to filter the counts according to the
minimum count per region per each individual/sample, which is setting by
'minCountPerIndv'.}

\item{CountPerBp}{for each group the count per bp must be equal or greater
than CountPerBp. The filter is applied if 'CountPerBp' is given and if
'x' DESeqDataSet object has the rowRanges as a GRanges object on it}

\item{minCountPerIndv}{each gene or region must have more than
'minCountPerIndv' counts (on average) per individual in at least one
group.}

\item{maxGrpCV}{A numerical vector. Maximum coefficient of variance for each
group. Default maxGrpCV = NULL. The numbers 'maxGrpCV1' and
'maxGrpCV2' will be taken as the maximun variances values permitted in
control and in treatment groups, respectively. If only 'maxGrpCV1' is
provided, then maxGrpCV = c('maxGrpCV1', 'maxGrpCV1'). This parameter
is addressed to prevent testing regions where intra-group variations are
very large, e.g.: control = c(1,0,1,1) and treatment = c(1, 0, 1, 40).
The coefficient of variance for the treatment group is 1.87, very high.
The generalized linear regression analysis would yield statistical
significant group differences, but evidently there is something wrong in
one of the treatment samples. We would try the application of further
statistical smoothing approach, but we prefer to leave the user decide
which regions to test.}

\item{FilterLog2FC}{if TRUE, the results are filtered using the minimum
absolute value of log2FoldChanges observed to accept that a gene in the
treatment is differentially expressed in respect to the control}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{method used to adjust the results; default: BH}

\item{pvalCutOff}{cutoff used then a p-value adjustment is performed.}

\item{MVrate}{Minimum Mean/Variance rate.}

\item{Minlog2FC}{minimum logarithm base 2 of fold changes.}

\item{test}{A character string matching one of 'Wald' or 'LRT'. If test =
'Wald', then the p-value of the Wald test for the coefficient of the
independent variable (\emph{treatment group}) will be reported.
If test = 'LRT', then the p-value from a likelihood ratio test given by
\code{\link[stats]{anova}} function from \emph{stats} packages will be
the reported p-value for the group comparison when the best fitted model
is the negative binomial. As suggested for \code{\link[stats]{glm}}, if
best fitted model is Poisson or quasi-Poisson, then the best test is
'Chi-squared' or 'F-test', respectively. So, for the sake of simplicity,
the corresponding suitable test will be applied when test = 'LRT'.}

\item{scaling}{integer (default 1). Scaling factor estimate the
signal density as: scaling x 'DMP-Count-Per-Bp'. For example,
if scaling = 1000, then signal density denotes the number of DMPs in
1000 bp.}

\item{saveAll}{if TRUE all the temporal results are returned}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout}
}
\value{
a data frame or GRanges object (if the DS contain the GRanges
information for each gene) with the test results and original count
matrix, plus control and treatment signal densities and their variation.
}
\description{
Perform Poisson and Negative Binomial regression analysis to
compare the counts from different groups, treatment and control. The
difference between functions 'countTest2' and 'countTest' resides in the
estimation of the prior weights used in Negative Binomial generalized
linear model.
}
\details{
A pairwise group comparison, control versus treatment, is performed.
The experimental design settings must be introduced using function
\code{\link[MethylIT]{glmDataSet}} to provide dataset (DS) object.
