\usage{
fitGGammaDist(
  x,
  parameter.values,
  location.par = FALSE,
  sample.size = 20,
  npoints = NULL,
  maxiter = 1024,
  ftol = 1e-12,
  ptol = 1e-12,
  maxfev = 1e+05,
  nlms = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numerical vector}

\item{parameter.values}{initial parameter values for the nonlinear fit. If
the locator parameter is included (mu != 0), this must be given as
parameter.values = list(alpha = 'value', scale = 'value', mu = 'value',
psi = 'value') or if mu = 0, as: parameter.values =list(alpha = 'value',
scale = 'value', psi = 'value'). If not provided, then an initial guess
is provided.}

\item{location.par}{whether to consider the fitting to generalized gamma
distribution (GGamma) including the location parameter, i.e., a GGamma
with four parameters (GGamma4P).}

\item{sample.size}{Minimum size of the sample.}

\item{npoints}{number of points used in the fit. If the number of points if
greater than 10^6, then the fit is automatically set to npoints = 999999.
However, the reported values for R.Cross.val, AIC, and BIC are
computed taking into account the whole set of points.}

\item{maxiter}{positive integer. Termination occurs when the number of
iterations reaches maxiter. Default value: 1024.}

\item{ftol}{non-negative numeric. Termination occurs when both the actual
and predicted relative reductions in the sum of squares are at most ftol.
Therefore, ftol measures the relative error desired in the sum of
squares. Default value: 1e-12}

\item{ptol}{non-negative numeric. Termination occurs when the relative error
between two consecutive iterates is at most ptol. Therefore, ptol
measures the relative error desired in the approximate solution.
Default value: 1e-12.}

\item{maxfev}{integer; termination occurs when the number of calls to fn has
reached maxfev. Note that nls.lm sets the value of maxfev to
100*(length(par) + 1) if maxfev = integer(), where par is the list or
vector of parameters to be optimized.}

\item{nlms}{Logical. Whether to return the nonlinear model object
\code{\link[minpack.lm]{nls.lm}}. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout}

\item{...}{arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
Model table with coefficients and goodness-of-fit results:
Adj.R.Square, deviance, AIC, R.Cross.val, and rho, as well as, the
coefficient covariance matrix. If \strong{nlms = TRUE}, then a list with
nonlinear model object \code{\link[minpack.lm]{nls.lm}} is returned.
}
\description{
This function performs the nonlinear fit of GGamma CDF of a
variable x
}
\details{
The script algorithm tries to fit the three-parameter GGamma CDF
('GGamma3P') or the four-parameter GGamma ('GGamma4P') using a modification
of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in function 'nls.lm' from
'minpack.lm' package that is used to perform the nonlinear fit.
Cross-validations for the nonlinear regressions (R.Cross.val) were performed
in each methylome as described in reference (1). In addition, Stein's formula
for adjusted R squared (rho) was used as an estimator of the average
cross-validation predictive power (1).

If the number of values to fit is >10^6, the fitting to a GGamma CDF would be
a time consuming task. To reduce the computational time, the option
summarized.data' can be set 'TRUE'. If npoint != NULL, the original variable
values are summarized into 'npoint' bins and their midpoints are used as the
new predictors. In this case, only the goodness-of-fit indicators AIC and
R.Cross.val are estimated based on all the original variable x values.
